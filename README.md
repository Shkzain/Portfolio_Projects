Portfolio Projects

This repository is a curated collection of personal frontend development projects built to showcase practical skills in web technologies.
It is structured to organize multiple individual projects in separate folders, each focusing on different aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Whether you're a potential employer, collaborator, or fellow developer, this repository provides a clear reflection of my journey and growth in frontend development.

Repository Structure

- Each project is self-contained in its own folder.
- Projects are built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The repository serves as a portfolio archive to demonstrate hands-on coding, styling, UI/UX structure, and interactive behavior using JavaScript.

Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

- Maintain a structured portfolio of completed web projects
- Document learning progress and development experience
- Share work with others for feedback and collaboration

Notes

- More projects will be added over time.
- Feel free to explore, review the code, or suggest improvements.
